**DocMe Chatbot** is an intelligent virtual assistant developed as a technological solution to structural issues in Colombia’s healthcare system. Its purpose is to **enhance accessibility and efficiency** in medical care by facilitating appointment scheduling and providing immediate responses through artificial intelligence.

## Context

The Colombian healthcare system faces challenges such as **overloaded service lines** and long delays in accessing medical services. **DocMe** addresses these limitations with a modern technological approach, offering users a direct, fast, and reliable experience.

## Key Features

The chatbot is designed to handle various types of interactions in a natural and intuitive manner:

- **Greeting and welcome:** Detects common greetings like “hello” or “how are you?” and responds politely.
- **Assistant identity:** Explains its function as a virtual assistant focused on managing medical appointments.
- **Emotional support:** Recognizes expressions like “I feel bad” or “I have anxiety” and provides emotional support or suggests professional help.
- **Physical symptoms:** Understands physical discomfort and suggests booking a medical consultation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main language for backend development.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for building APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy + MySQL**: ORM and database system for storing user and appointment data.
- **TensorFlow + Keras**: Used to train and run **neural networks** for user intent classification.
- **NLTK + PySpellChecker**: Natural language processing and spell correction tools.
- **SciKit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Numpy**: Mathematical processing and array handling.
- **Waitress**: WSGI production server to deploy the Flask app.
- **PyMySQL**: Database connector for communication between Flask and MySQL.

## Responsibilities and Contributions

- Designed and programmed the **entire chatbot architecture**, from model training to integration with a web application.
- Implemented key features for **natural language handling**, intent classification, and automatic responses.
- Configured an efficient production server using **Waitress** with optimized database connection.
- Applied **best practices** in backend and machine learning development to ensure scalability and performance.

## Results and Benefits

Thanks to the chatbot, users can now access basic medical information, manage appointments, and receive preliminary care without depending on long queues or busy phone lines. This significantly **reduces the operational load of healthcare centers** and improves the patient experience.

## Conclusion

The **DocMe assistant** is more than a chatbot: it is a tool for digital transformation in healthcare. This project allowed me to **deepen my expertise in applied artificial intelligence**, **natural language processing**, and **scalable backend development**, strengthening my ability to tackle complex challenges and create real-world solutions that make a difference.
