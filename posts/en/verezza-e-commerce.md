**Verezza** is an urban fashion brand focused on authenticity and self-expression. The project involved designing and developing an online store from scratch, with a modern, visually appealing, and fully functional user experience using high-performance development tools.

The goal was to build a fast, accessible, and scalable e-commerce site aligned with a strong visual identity and a professional technical architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Main library for building the UI  
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for more robust and scalable code  
- **Remix**: Framework for SSR, dynamic routing, and enhanced performance  
- **GraphQL**: Efficient data querying for products  
- **Shopify Storefront API**: Direct integration with Shopify as a headless backend  

## What I Did

- Designed and developed the **entire frontend** of the e-commerce site using **Remix** and **React**.  
- Implemented authentication, navigation, product filters, shopping cart, and checkout flow.  
- Connected to **Shopify** using its **Storefront API** via GraphQL to fetch products, collections, and variants.  
- Applied a responsive design, optimized for both mobile and desktop.  
- Optimized web performance using SSR strategies, lazy loading, and cache control.  
- Added client and server-side logic in Remix with solid state and error handling.  

## What I Learned

- How to integrate Shopify as a headless CMS using the **Storefront API**, and how to structure efficient GraphQL queries.  
- The way Remix handles hybrid rendering (SSR + CSR) and how to fully leverage its features.  
- Improved my **TypeScript** practices, especially in handling typed data from external APIs.  
- Built more complex checkout flows while maintaining a smooth user experience.  
- Gained deeper insight into user-centered design and microinteractions for online stores.  

## Conclusion

**Verezza** was more than just a development projectâ€”it was an opportunity to work at the intersection of design, user experience, and modern technical architecture. It allowed me to solidify my full-stack skills and work with a professional-grade tech stack used in real-world e-commerce applications.
