**Ferretería Rueda - Official Online Store** is a real-world e-commerce project built to digitally transform a traditional hardware business with over 30 years of experience in Barranquilla, Colombia. Before this project, the company had no online sales channel or web presence beyond social media.

## Project Approach

The goal was to create its **first fully functional online sales platform**, tailored to their physical catalog and customer needs. I used **Shopify** as the base and developed the entire store from scratch using **Liquid**, the platform’s template language. This was my **first experience with Liquid**, where I learned deeply about its logic structures, conditionals, reusable blocks (`sections`, `snippets`), and how to work with Shopify’s internal data models.

## Features Developed

I enhanced the store with custom **JavaScript** functionality to improve user experience, while ensuring compatibility with Shopify’s native features:

- **Dynamic product carousel** on the homepage.
- **Multi-level dropdown menus** for seamless category navigation.
- **Custom filters** on product collection pages.
- **Search bar functionality**, allowing users to quickly find products by name or keywords.
- **Automatic discount badge**, displayed on any product with an active sale.
- **Fully flexible admin interface**, enabling store admins to rearrange, show/hide sections, and edit content without any coding — thanks to the flexibility of **Liquid**.
- **Responsive interaction** for a smooth experience on mobile and tablet devices.
- **Additional scripts** for form validation and overall usability improvements.

Every component was adapted to the client's needs, keeping the codebase clean, modular, and ready for production.

## What I Learned

Through this project I was able to:

- Learn **Liquid** from scratch and understand how custom Shopify themes are built.
- Write reusable, dynamic code in a component-based system.
- Integrate **JavaScript** features without disrupting Shopify’s internal logic.
- Translate traditional sales processes into a **modern e-commerce flow**.

## Impact and Outcome

The launch of the online store marked a strategic turning point for the business:

- Ferretería Rueda now has its **first digital sales channel**, live and scalable.
- A portion of their physical catalog was successfully digitized for national visibility.
- Their brand presence was elevated with a **modern, professional, and user-friendly website**.

This opened a new growth path for the company in the digital commerce space.

## Conclusion

This project represented a real transformation — from zero online presence to a fully functional, modern, and scalable store. It helped solidify my skills in **Shopify + Liquid**, and taught me how to build custom frontend experiences within a structured e-commerce environment. More than a technical challenge, it was a practical solution that helped a small business take a major step into the digital world.
